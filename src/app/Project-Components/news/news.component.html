                  The FiDLE team recently won the 2021 award for creativity and innovation in designing the Multifaceted Shared Federated Analytical Ecosystem to address FDA data sharing needs. FiDLE, formally known as EBDA, or Enterprise Business Data Analytics, is comprised of (NAMES AND TITLES). The team started their journey in September of 2019, and set out to solve a number of problems primarily associated with data scientists needs in access and analyzing refreshed datasets on-demand, sharing common data sets with team members, and extracting data from multiple internal and/or external systems. Today, FiDLE has proven efficacy through two project pilots with CDER’s Resource Capacity Planning (RCP) group and the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP). RCP data scientist’s work currently needs an exceptional amount of data transfers between system through legacy data transfer mechanisms; from data ingestion to aggregation, and analytics, modeling and model output for visualization. FiDLE provides RCP with a cloud platform that has scalable storage and compute power that will allow direct connectivity to 19 internal and external data sources. RCP will have automated, scheduled data extraction and on-demand data refresh – processing power will be improved by at least 50% and have significant improvements in model development, testing, validating, and deployment lifecycle. OPDP needed a solution for all post-market monitoring of approved drugs from file-types (print, images, video, audio, etc.) to determine if promotional claims are consistent with FDA approved labeling. Their previous process hindered their processing capabilities with structured and unstructured data. OPDP had difficulty in analyzing different formats and consumed too much time trying to process discrepancies between FDA approved drug labels and promotional claims. Through FiDLE, OPDP has a solution that allows data crawl for unstructured content and structured data. The FiDLE platform provides OPDP Artificially Intelligent tools for natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, speech transcription, and automatic Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
